# Design-and-Verification-of-a-1-3-Packet-Switching-Router-using-Verilog-HDL
This project designs a 1Ã—3 packet-switching router in Verilog HDL. It routes data to three output ports using header-based logic and FIFO buffers. Verified using Xilinx tools, it includes FSM control, simulation testbench, and waveform analysis for functionality.
